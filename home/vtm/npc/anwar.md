# Backstory
Anwar was appointed as a Primogen by Lisette after the invaluable service that he performed during the Lupine Uprisings. The exact actions that he performed are unknown to the players at this point. Anwar is said to be able to grant enormous favors. It is said that any kindred can recieve one of these favors for free; the next one comes at a much higher price.
