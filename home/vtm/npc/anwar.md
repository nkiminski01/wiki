<!-- TITLE: Anwar -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Member of the Primogen-->

# General Information
**Clan:** Follower of Set

One of few, perhaps the only, [Follower of Set](/home/vtm/npc#followers-of-set) in the city during these nights.

# Backstory
Anwar was appointed as a [Primogen](/home/vtm/npc#primogen) by [Lisette](/home/vtm/npc/lisette) after the invaluable service that he performed during the [Lupine Uprisings](/home/vtm/events/lupinewar). The exact actions that he performed are unknown to the players at this point. [Niels](/home/vtm/npc/niels) gave Julian some more information on the situation. Anwar was able to procure some item or some thing that forced the two sides to the table. It was a thing that was not exclusive to Anwar, but Anwar was in the best position to provide it. ***META: Nick believes this to be an item/secret that would ensure mutually assured distruction***

Anwar is said to be able to grant enormous favors. It is said that any kindred can recieve one of these favors for free; the next one comes at a much higher price.
