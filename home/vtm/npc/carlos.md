# Backstory
Carlos took part in the purge and was at Jim's side when the purge when wrong.  He was caught by Don, Frank and Julian inside a coffee shop along with Jim while there were actively in conflict with some of the Unmastered, to include Rich.

Carlos called upon Julian because he thought he was being followed.  Neither Julian nor Carlos saw anyone that night.

A short while after that night Frank and Robin entered into Carlos's apartment for some still unknown purpose.

Carlos has been missing since the night Gregor was assassinated and in his apartment there were signs of a struggle ( a bent faucet tap, misaligned freezer door on the fridge and a broken drywall behind the fridge).
