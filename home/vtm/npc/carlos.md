# Recent Nights
Carlos took part in the [purge](/home/vtm/events/purge) and was at [Jim](/home/vtm/npc/jim)'s side when the [purge](/home/vtm/events/purge) went wrong.  He was caught by Don, Frank and Julian inside a coffee shop along with Jim while [Jim](/home/vtm/npc/jim) and Carlos were actively in conflict with some of the Unmastered, to include Rich.

Prior to this Carlos and [Jim](/home/vtm/npc/jim) had been running deliberately through downtown Minneapolis killing all people, mortals and immortals alike in [3 specific locations](/home/vtm/events/purge).

Carlos, sometime later called upon Julian because he thought he was being followed.  Neither Julian nor Carlos saw anyone that night.
A short while after that night Frank and [Robin](/home/vtm/npc/robin) entered into Carlos's apartment for some still unknown purpose.

Carlos has been missing since the night [Gregor](/home/vtm/npc/gregor) was [assassinated](/home/vtm/events/gregordead) and in his apartment there were signs of a struggle ( a bent faucet tap, misaligned freezer door on the fridge and a broken drywall behind the fridge).
