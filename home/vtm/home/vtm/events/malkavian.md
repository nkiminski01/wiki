# Malkavian Migration
The absence of the Malkavians has been noted by a few characters.

* 30-40 years ago they left the city entirely.
* Abbadon either didn't know or decided not to tell Frank why they had left
* Wasn't by a ruling of Lisette, though she was unconcerned/relieved they were not in the Minneapolis scene anymore
