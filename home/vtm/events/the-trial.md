# Testimony
The trio of Don, Frank, and Julian are called to testify at Jim's trial
The party is mostly forthcoming, though they do not mention a few things: the interrogation of Jim and any findings from that (notibly that Anwar supplied a map); Carlos being involved; the discussion with RÃ­ch 

# Sentence and comments
**Votes of the Primogen**
* Lisette: Guilty

* Niels: Guilty. Calls for a weak punishment
* Anwar: Not Guilty. 
* Adalise: Guilty.
* Vauclair: Guilty. This kind of behavior is unacceptable in the city and an example should be made of Jim
* Natasha: Guilty. Does not believe the details as they were given, but they were close enough to correct to pass a sentence.
* Abaddon: Abstains
* Gregor: Not Guilty. Causes an uproar, says that the whole thing was decided before any testimony was heard. This is Kangaroo court. Storms out.

Jim is sentenced to a month of being encased in concrete and fed just enough blood to keep him awake the entire time. Samuel carries out the encasing in front of everyone.
